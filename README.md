# Rust Web Development (Axum)

I am learning web development with Rust, and I'm using the book [Rust Web
Development](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-web-development) as my guide.

In this project, I've chosen to use the
[axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) web framework instead of the framework
taught in the book, which is [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp). My
decision was driven by a desire to avoid merely copying and pasting code from
the book, although I do maintain another repository of this same project using
the warp framework.
